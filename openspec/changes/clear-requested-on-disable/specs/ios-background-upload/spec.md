## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Disabling the extension clears orphaned REQUESTED rows

Disabling the upload extension (`setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(false)`) deletes the system's
`AssetResourceUploadJobConfiguration` and therefore **wipes every in-flight OS upload job**. Whenever
the app disables the extension it SHALL, immediately after the disable, **both** (a) call the ledger's
`clearRequested()` (`sync-ledger`) to drop the now-orphaned `REQUESTED` rows, and (b) **reset the
discovery cursor** (clear the App-Group change-token) so the next cycle does a **full re-enumeration**.
Both are required: `clearRequested()` only makes the keys *absent*, but a settled cursor scans
incrementally and would never re-surface them — so without the cursor reset the cleared photos are
re-discovered only when the library next changes. This SHALL apply to **both** disable paths: the
disable half of the `disable→enable` re-register, and the leave use-case's extension-disable.

Without `clearRequested()`, the rows stay `REQUESTED` forever: the engine treats `REQUESTED` as
in-flight and never re-issues it, there is no API to enumerate live jobs to detect that the job is
gone, and a same-event cycle never reconciles — so the photos that were mid-upload at the disable are
permanently abandoned. With both clears, the next full enumeration re-discovers the cleared keys and
re-creates exactly the not-yet-stored jobs (stored files remain `COMPLETED` and are skipped). The app
SHALL route both disable paths through a single helper so they cannot diverge, and SHALL use the
`LedgerBackend` directly (constructing no `LedgerWriter`), since `clearRequested` is an app-side
reset-family operation.

#### Scenario: A re-register self-heals instead of orphaning

- **WHEN** photos are mid-upload (`REQUESTED` rows, OS jobs registered, the discovery cursor settled)
  and the app re-registers the extension (disable→enable)
- **THEN** the disable wipes the OS jobs, `clearRequested()` drops the `REQUESTED` rows, and the
  discovery cursor is reset — so the next cycle's full re-enumeration re-discovers and re-creates the
  not-yet-stored jobs (bytes resume landing), with no permanently-stuck `REQUESTED`

#### Scenario: Leave clears REQUESTED

- **WHEN** the leave use-case disables the extension while resources are `REQUESTED`
- **THEN** `clearRequested()` runs as part of the disable, leaving no orphaned `REQUESTED` rows behind

#### Scenario: Completed rows survive the clear

- **WHEN** a disable triggers `clearRequested()` and the ledger holds `COMPLETED` rows for
  already-stored files
- **THEN** those `COMPLETED` rows are retained, so a subsequent reconcile/discovery does not re-upload
  already-stored bytes
