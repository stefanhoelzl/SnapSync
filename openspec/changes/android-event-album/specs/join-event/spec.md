## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The member decides separately whether to share, whether to receive, and whether to keep an album
The join screen SHALL show the event's name and two switches — share my photos, and receive everyone's
photos — both on by default, and SHALL NOT make the user pick a named mode. Neither switch SHALL ever
flip the other. With sharing on, the screen SHALL state what is never shared (screenshots, screen
recordings, GIFs and pictures saved from chat apps, capability `photo-sharing`) and the capture range
being shared; with it off, it SHALL say that nothing of the user's leaves the phone and hide the range.
With both switches off, Join SHALL be disabled and the reason stated beside it. The screen SHALL also offer
the event-album choice (capability `event-album`), whose note names only the photos the current switches would
collect — on Android only received photos ever are.

#### Scenario: Both switches start on
- **WHEN** the join screen has loaded an event
- **THEN** it shows the event's name, "share my photos" on with the shared range and the exclusions, and "receive everyone's photos" on

#### Scenario: Receive only
- **WHEN** the user turns sharing off and joins
- **THEN** none of the user's photos are shared to the event, and the event's photos arrive in their library (capability `receiving-photos`)

#### Scenario: Share only
- **WHEN** the user turns receiving off and joins
- **THEN** the user's photos in range are shared and none of the event's photos arrive in their library

#### Scenario: Both off blocks Join with a reason
- **WHEN** the user turns both switches off
- **THEN** Join is disabled, a line above it explains that a membership that neither shares nor receives does nothing, and neither switch turns itself back on

#### Scenario: The album choice on Android
- **WHEN** the join screen has loaded an event on an Android phone
- **THEN** it offers the two switches, the range, and the album choice switched on, whose note names the photos they receive

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: The member decides separately whether to share and whether to receive

**Reason**: Replaced by the requirement of the new name, which offers the event album on Android too; the scenario "No album choice on Android" no longer holds.
**Migration**: None: the other switches and scenarios are carried over unchanged.
