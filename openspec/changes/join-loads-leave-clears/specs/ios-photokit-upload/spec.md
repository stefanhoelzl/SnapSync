## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Background upload extension target

On iOS ≥26.1 the system SHALL provide an iOS app-extension target conforming to the iOS 26.1 `PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension` protocol (an ExtensionKit `AppExtension`, declared via a `@main` Swift principal class), embedded in the host app with `NSExtensionPointIdentifier = com.apple.photos.background-upload`. The platform-agnostic upload **orchestration** — the upload cycle (`UploadCycle`, `:domain` `feature/upload`), the fine-grained OS-verb platform seam (`BackgroundTransfer`, `:domain` `ports/`), the library-read seam (`UploadDiscovery`, `:domain` `ports/`), and the config assembly (`UploadConfig`/`buildUploadConfig`, `:domain` `feature/upload`) — SHALL live in `:domain` (migration step 5; formerly `:capability:upload`), which declares **`jvm()`** alongside `iosArm64`/`iosSimulatorArm64` — no Compose/UI — so the orchestration tests run on JVM (and the iOS simulator) per capability `testing-architecture` ("Every test runs on every target its module declares"). The extension SHALL assemble its cycle through the **shared composition** `uploadCore` (`:domain` `compose/`, spec `module-architecture` "One shared composition"): the root supplies only its ports and platform reads — the file-backed `ConfigReader`, the device-identity thunk, the compile-time host read, the PhotoKit platform adapter, the PhotoKit discovery (`IosDiscovery`, bound once as the `UploadDiscovery`), and the generic HTTP adapters (`:adapter:generic:app`'s `HttpEnrollment` is the device-manifest uploader; there is no extension-local uploader copy). The **PhotoKit platform adapter** (`IosPhotoKitUploadPlatform`, the `BackgroundTransfer` impl) SHALL live in the extension-safe adapter module `:adapter:ios:ext-safe` — an adapter is placed by linkage and MAY branch on technology vocabulary (spec `module-architecture`; seated there at the migration finale — its former shell seat put adapter branching inside the zero-decision shell gate's scope), beside the shared PhotoKit discovery the roots bind (the `IosDiscovery` full-enumeration walk, implementing `UploadDiscovery`) and the shared upload-request builder, both shared with the `ios-url-session-upload` adapter, and the file-backed `ConfigSource`. The **compile-time host read** (`bakedUploadBase`, the `uploadBase` value read from the bundled `Deployment.plist`) SHALL live in `:adapter:ios:ext-safe` beside the build-version read the boot banner uses, for the same two reasons: **both processes** read it (each `NSBundle.mainBundle` being its own bundle), and its absent-key defaulting is a **decision**, which the zero-decision shell gate forbids a wiring-only root to hold — the same reasoning that seated `IosPhotoKitUploadPlatform` there at the migration finale. The composition root (`UploadExtensionRoot`) SHALL live in a lean `:app:ios:extension` module that **composes** `:domain` (which also carries the upload receive seam in `feature/upload`), `:adapter:ios:ext-safe`, and `:adapter:generic:app`, and is packaged as its own static framework. The Swift shell SHALL be a thin pass-through that forwards `process()` and `notifyTermination()` into the Kotlin core; all discovery, decision, ledger, and job-disposition logic SHALL be Kotlin/Native. The extension bundle SHALL carry the generated `Deployment.plist` (capability `deployment-configuration`), whose `uploadBase` is the compile-time edge host the app and the extension **read** when they build upload requests. The extension `Info.plist` SHALL **additionally** declare `BackgroundUploadURLBase`, carrying that same base URL: it is read not by this app but by **`assetsd`**, which validates the registration insert against the value in the bundle's own `Info.plist` and can see no resource the app bundles. With the key absent, `setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(true)` SHALL be expected to fail with a bare `PHPhotosErrorDomain -1` and empty `userInfo`, the OS never launches the extension, and nothing uploads on this tier. Because an `Info.plist` substitution can only read a build setting and `//` opens a comment anywhere on an xcconfig line with no escape, the value SHALL be **composed** in the `Info.plist` from build settings that cannot themselves contain `//` — a scheme enum and a bare host — rather than carried as one URL-valued build setting. The app bundle SHALL carry the key on the same terms: the registration call is made by the app process, and which bundle the daemon reads has not been established. What IS established is a device A/B (SE2, iOS 26.6, 2026-08-28, one variable): key absent → enable fails `-1`, disable fails `3201`; key present as `https://<domain>/api/v1` → both succeed and the read-back is `true`. The daemon's **matching rule** — whether it compares host, origin or prefix — is NOT established, and this spec SHALL NOT assert one. ⏰ Re-measure at the next iOS major, with the other PhotoKit platform facts. The extension SHALL NOT relax App Transport Security: the `Info.plist` SHALL declare no `NSAppTransportSecurity` exception (no `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`, no `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`), so default ATS applies and the upload host MUST be a valid HTTPS endpoint. Supplying a non-HTTPS host is a build/configuration error; iOS blocks the plaintext request at the platform level.

#### Scenario: Extension declares the PhotoKit background-upload point
- **WHEN** the extension target is built
- **THEN** its Info.plist declares `NSExtensionPointIdentifier = com.apple.photos.background-upload`, a principal class, its bundle carries `Deployment.plist` with a non-empty `uploadBase`, its `Info.plist` declares a non-empty `BackgroundUploadURLBase` equal to that `uploadBase`, it links the `:app:ios:extension` framework (which composes `:domain` and the adapter modules), and it declares **no** `NSAppTransportSecurity` exception (default HTTPS-only ATS)

#### Scenario: Logic is Kotlin, shell is thin
- **WHEN** the system invokes `process()` on the Swift principal class
- **THEN** the shell delegates to the Kotlin core, which performs all discovery, engine decisions, ledger writes, and job disposition

#### Scenario: Orchestration is JVM-reachable
- **WHEN** the upload orchestration's tests are run
- **THEN** because `UploadCycle`/`BackgroundTransfer`/`UploadDiscovery`/`UploadConfig` live in `:domain` (a `jvm()`-enabled module), the tests execute on JVM **and** `iosSimulatorArm64`, not on the iOS targets alone

#### Scenario: Extension adapters compose the capability
- **WHEN** the extension's composition root assembles a cycle
- **THEN** the iOS adapters (`IosPhotoKitUploadPlatform`, `IosDiscovery`) implement the upload seams — `IosDiscovery` shared with the app-driven tier from `:adapter:ios:ext-safe` and bound once as the `UploadDiscovery` — and the root supplies them as `UploadPorts` to `uploadCore`, which constructs the `:domain` `feature/upload` `UploadCycle`, with the download-store / manifest edges answered in the ports bundle rather than inside the feature

#### Scenario: The app-driven tier applies below 26.1
- **WHEN** the app runs on iOS 18–26.0 (below the `PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension` floor)
- **THEN** no PhotoKit upload extension is invoked; the `ios-url-session-upload` capability's app-driven path performs uploads instead, over the same shared `:domain` orchestration assembled by the same `uploadCore`

#### Scenario: The extension's cycle is the shared composition
- **WHEN** `UploadExtensionRoot` assembles its upload cycle
- **THEN** it calls `uploadCore` over its ports — it constructs no cycle, gate, join marker, or
  device-manifest producer of its own, and its device-manifest uploader is `:adapter:generic:app`'s
  `HttpEnrollment`

#### Scenario: The registration is refused when the daemon's key is absent

- **WHEN** the extension bundle carries no `BackgroundUploadURLBase` in its `Info.plist`
- **THEN** `setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(true)` fails with `PHPhotosErrorDomain -1` and empty `userInfo`,
  the OS launches the extension never, and no diagnosis is available from the error itself

#### Scenario: The baked value is composed from `//`-free build settings

- **WHEN** the `Info.plist` value is rendered
- **THEN** it is composed from a scheme enum and a bare host emitted as separate build settings, so no
  single build setting carries a value containing `//`, which the xcconfig grammar would truncate silently

### Requirement: Re-provision resets sync state

On a **valid event-link (re)scan**, the host app SHALL re-provision the (possibly new) event
by persisting the config and driving the upload arm through the tier-neutral lifecycle
(`upload-lifecycle`). The mechanism below is **this tier's** (iOS ≥26.1) and SHALL NOT be applied on
the app-driven tier, which has no OS registration record to re-create (see `ios-url-session-upload`,
"App-driven lifecycle").

A **switch** (a re-provision into a different event) is a leave followed by a join (capabilities
`upload-lifecycle`, `join-event`). On this tier it SHALL run in the app, in this order: the arm **stops**
this mechanism (the disable alone — see "Re-registering the extension demotes orphaned REQUESTED rows"),
the provision's **join-time load** re-baselines the ledger — it fetches the
per-device file listing (capability `api-endpoints`) and **`resetTo`s** (atomic clear-and-seed) the ledger
to one already-uploaded row per stored file, or `clear()`s it when the fetch fails — through the app's
`LedgerStore`, with no `LedgerWriter` (see `ios-app-shell`, "The app resets the upload ledger at membership
transitions on every tier"), the new config is then saved, and only then does the arm's `start()`
re-register the extension (the
disable→enable toggle). A first join takes the same load before the first registration. The extension
therefore never re-baselines the ledger itself: it constructs no join marker and runs no in-cycle
reconciliation, and its first cycle after the re-register already reads the loaded ledger.

The device-global listing seeds the stored files as already-uploaded, so **nothing already stored
re-uploads**, while the clear drops every row from before the provision and the cycle's walk, a full
enumeration like every walk, finds genuinely-unstored work. The extension's next cycle **re-projects**
the re-baselined ledger to the **new** event's `device.json` path. Rows seeded from the listing are
**bare** (a filename carries no capture date) and are therefore not listed until the walk backfills their
manifest detail; a bare row is always re-read by the walk (capability `sync-ledger`, "A walk re-reads only
the assets the ledger does not fully know"). The app decodes the event link only to gate this on a
valid payload; the authoritative decode/validate/persist still happens in the shared container intent.

A re-provision of the **already-joined** event SHALL NOT reset the ledger: only a provision that changes
the membership loads it. The re-register's repair demotes rows instead (see "Re-registering the extension
demotes orphaned REQUESTED rows").

#### Scenario: Valid re-scan re-baselines and re-projects to the new event
- **WHEN** a valid `https://<link domain>/join#…` event link is opened for a different event on iOS ≥26.1
- **THEN** the app disables the extension, `resetTo`s the ledger from the per-device file listing, saves
  the new config, and re-registers the extension (disable→enable), and the extension's next
  cycle re-projects `device.json` from that ledger to the new event path

#### Scenario: Already-stored photos do not re-upload on a switch
- **WHEN** the device switches to an event whose photos are already present in its device
  byte-partition (capability `api-endpoints`)
- **THEN** the join-time load's clear-and-seed seeds them as already-uploaded and the extension creates no
  new upload jobs for them

#### Scenario: Invalid event link does not re-provision
- **WHEN** an opened URL fails config decoding
- **THEN** no re-provision occurs (the ledger and the config are untouched)

#### Scenario: The disable→enable toggle is confined to this tier
- **WHEN** the app re-provisions an event on iOS 18–26.0
- **THEN** `setUploadJobExtensionEnabled` is not called, and the app-driven producer's `start()` runs instead

### Requirement: Re-registering the extension demotes orphaned REQUESTED rows

The app SHALL recover the in-flight jobs a disable wipes. Disabling the upload extension
(`setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(false)`) deletes the system's `AssetResourceUploadJobConfiguration` and
therefore **wipes every in-flight OS upload job**, and no API surfaces a vanished job. Without a recovery the
rows stay `REQUESTED` forever: the engine treats `REQUESTED` as in-flight and never re-issues it, and no
cycle re-baselines the ledger — so the photos that were mid-upload are permanently abandoned.

The recovery SHALL run in this mechanism's **`start()`** — the disable→enable re-register — **between** the
disable and the enable, and SHALL be the ledger's reset-family `demoteRequested()` (`sync-ledger`): every
`REQUESTED` row becomes `DISCOVERED`. Every one of them is unsettleable at that moment: the disable has just wiped
this tier's jobs, and wherever the app-driven mechanism also exists, starting this mechanism is preceded by the
app-driven mechanism's `stop()` (`upload-lifecycle`, "The upload mechanism is resolved, never selected"), so
no app-driven transfer is carrying a row either.

A `DISCOVERED` row needs a job, so the ledger's work read returns it on the next cycle without any walk
re-deriving it. The former recovery *deleted* the rows, which only a walk that re-read the asset's
resources could re-surface; a demoted row needs no such walk.

This mechanism's **`stop()`** SHALL be the disable alone and SHALL repair nothing — on a leave and on a
relinquish to the app-driven mechanism alike. On a leave nothing uploads until a mechanism starts again, and
the leave's own ledger clear — `LeaveEvent`'s, after this `stop()`, never this verb's (capability
`leave-event`) — leaves no row to repair; on a relinquish, the app-driven mechanism's own start repairs (`ios-url-session-upload`,
"Stranded reconciliation: scoped each cycle, complete at a start"). There SHALL therefore be no narrower
teardown verb for a hand-off.

The demote SHALL be **awaited off the main thread and completed before the enable**. The write SHALL run on
`Dispatchers.Default` (Kotlin/Native has no `Dispatchers.IO`), never on the `Dispatchers.Main` scope — it is a
synchronous SQLite write that on the main thread is a hang risk under cross-process WAL contention — and SHALL
use a small bounded retry around the write. `setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(true)` SHALL NOT be called until the
demote has completed, so a `REQUESTED` row the re-enabled extension records can never be demoted by a
still-running repair. The demote SHALL NOT be fire-and-forget. The bounded-retry, off-main helper is pure logic
and SHALL live in a tested `:domain` helper (`feature/upload`), not in the untested app shell.

The app SHALL use the `LedgerStore` directly (constructing no `LedgerWriter`): on this tier the extension is
the one recording process, and `demoteRequested` is a reset-family operation that a non-writer may perform.

#### Scenario: A re-register self-heals instead of orphaning

- **WHEN** photos are mid-upload (`REQUESTED` rows, OS jobs registered)
  and the app re-registers the extension (disable→enable)
- **THEN** the disable wipes the OS jobs and `demoteRequested()` marks the rows `DISCOVERED`, so the next
  cycle's work read re-creates the not-yet-stored jobs (bytes resume landing), with no permanently-stuck
  `REQUESTED` and no re-read of the assets' resources

#### Scenario: The re-enable does not race the repair

- **WHEN** the app re-registers the extension (disable→enable)
- **THEN** `demoteRequested()` runs off-main and completes **before** `setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(true)`
  is called, so no `REQUESTED` row recorded by the re-enabled extension is demoted by the repair

#### Scenario: The repair runs off the main thread

- **WHEN** a re-register triggers `demoteRequested()`
- **THEN** the SQLite write executes on `Dispatchers.Default` (not the `Dispatchers.Main` scope) with
  a bounded retry, and is awaited rather than launched fire-and-forget

#### Scenario: A stop repairs nothing

- **WHEN** the extension is disabled by this mechanism's `stop()` — a leave, or a relinquish to the app-driven
  mechanism — while `REQUESTED` rows exist
- **THEN** the `stop()` itself changes no ledger row, and the rows are demoted by the next mechanism start
  (or removed by a leave's subsequent ledger clear)

#### Scenario: Completed rows survive the repair

- **WHEN** a re-register triggers `demoteRequested()` and the ledger holds `COMPLETED` rows for
  already-stored files
- **THEN** those `COMPLETED` rows are unchanged, so a subsequent discovery does not re-upload
  already-stored bytes

### Requirement: The extension root contains only what is tier-specific

`process()` SHALL contain only the two concerns that cannot be shared with another upload tier:

- **The synchronous OS contract** — the cycle is driven to completion and its result returned, because the
  OS invokes `process()` synchronously and the process does not outlive it.
- **The pending→processing requeue** — because the OS invokes this tier lazily, on library changes rather
  than on upload completion, this tier alone must ask to be re-invoked while jobs are still in flight.
  The requeue *decision* SHALL be the pure, tested `requeueWhilePending` rule (`:domain` `ports/`,
  beside the raw-value mapping — drained out of the root at the migration finale); the root supplies
  only the ledger read and the diagnostic line, leaving `process()` straight-line.

(The cross-process liveness notification this list used to carry is deleted — migration step 12:
the app's foreground-gated `aggregates()` poll replaced it; see `sync-status`.)

Everything else the root does today — the membership read's decision, the
engine and cycle assembly, the manifest and notify hooks, the cutoff and contribution derivation — SHALL
move to the shared cycle (capability `upload-lifecycle`). What remains SHALL be translation: mapping this
platform's storage and bundle into the shared decision function's arguments, with no branch a second tier
could answer differently.

The root is `iosMain`-only and untested by project rule (capability `testing-architecture`: `:app:ios` and
the extension's composition root are wiring-only and declare no test source set). That rule is a constraint on what may live there, not a licence: a decision placed in an
untested root reaches whichever tiers its author enumerated, which is how the reconciliation, the direction
gate, and the membership read each shipped on one tier and not the other.

#### Scenario: The skip decision is not made in the root
- **WHEN** the extension is invoked and its membership is unreadable
- **THEN** the skip is decided by the shared cycle, and the root neither branches on the read nor
  touches the ledger

#### Scenario: A drained cycle with pending jobs still asks for re-invocation
- **WHEN** the cycle would otherwise report completed and the ledger still holds pending rows
- **THEN** the extension surfaces processing instead, unchanged
