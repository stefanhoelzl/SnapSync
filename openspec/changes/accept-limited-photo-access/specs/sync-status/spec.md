# sync-status — delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ledger-backed source

The status domain SHALL provide a **ledger-backed** `SyncStatusSource` constructed via a
**non-suspending** factory taking a `LedgerCountsSource`, a `PhotoAccessStatusSource`, a
`GalleryStatusSource`, and a `CoroutineScope`. Status is **own-device progress** derived from (a) the
ledger's asset-counted `completed` and `pending` (via `LedgerCountsSource`); (b) permission; and (c) the
gallery total. The source SHALL read completeness and in-flight **only** through the `LedgerCountsSource`
and SHALL issue **no** storage LIST for upload status — `completed` is the ledger's complete-asset count,
`total` is the gallery count.

It SHALL seed its `status` with `SyncStatus.Loading` and, on the scope, combine the ledger counts,
permission, and the gallery size to emit `SyncStatus.Ready(SyncProgress)` once **all three** have each
produced a first value, re-emitting a new `Ready` per input change. Each minted `SyncProgress` SHALL set
`completed` = the ledger complete-asset count, `pending` = the ledger in-flight count **clamped to
`total − completed`**, `total` = the
gallery size, `active = (permission == GRANTED || permission == LIMITED)` — syncing is operational under
both full and limited grants (under `LIMITED` the total is the selection-scoped count per
`limited-photo-access`) — `failed = 0`, and `estimatedRemaining = null`, and
SHALL carry no completion timestamp.

**Liveness is trigger-driven, plus a foreground-gated poll.** The ledger counts SHALL be re-read on
**foreground entry**, on each tick of the **foreground-gated poll** (see "Foreground-gated
ledger-counts poll" — the replacement for the deleted extension liveness notification), and, on the
app-driven tier, after **each in-process pump cycle** (see `ios-url-session-upload`). A failed ledger
read SHALL retain the last good counts rather than regress (so a transient read error never drops
`completed` to zero and flips the screen out of "In sync").

#### Scenario: Initial value is Loading
- **WHEN** the source is constructed
- **THEN** `status.value` is `SyncStatus.Loading` synchronously, before any source read completes

#### Scenario: Ready waits for ledger counts, permission, and gallery
- **WHEN** permission has produced a value but the ledger counts or the gallery size has not
- **THEN** `status.value` is still `SyncStatus.Loading`, and the first `Ready` is emitted only once all
  three have a value

#### Scenario: Completed and pending derive from the ledger
- **WHEN** the ledger reports `4` complete assets and `2` in-flight assets and the gallery total is `7`
- **THEN** the minted snapshot has `completed = 4`, `pending = 2`, `total = 7`

#### Scenario: A limited grant is active
- **WHEN** permission is `LIMITED` and the counts have produced values
- **THEN** the minted snapshot has `active = true` — a limited membership is syncing, not blocked

#### Scenario: A ledger count change re-mints a Ready snapshot
- **WHEN** the `LedgerCountsSource` value changes after the first `Ready`
- **THEN** the source emits a new `Ready` with the updated `completed`/`pending` and otherwise unchanged
  counts

#### Scenario: Gallery and permission changes re-mint
- **WHEN** the gallery size changes, or permission flips, after the first `Ready`
- **THEN** the source emits a new `Ready` with the updated `progress.total`, respectively
  `progress.active`, and otherwise unchanged counts

#### Scenario: A poll tick re-reads the ledger with no network
- **WHEN** the foreground-gated poll ticks while the app is foreground
- **THEN** the source re-reads the ledger counts and re-emits on change — issuing no storage LIST

#### Scenario: A failed ledger read keeps the last value
- **WHEN** a ledger count read fails (absent file, open error)
- **THEN** the source retains its previous counts and does not throw, and does not regress `completed`
  to zero
