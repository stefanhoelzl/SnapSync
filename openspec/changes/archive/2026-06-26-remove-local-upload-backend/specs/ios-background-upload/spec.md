## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Background upload extension target

The system SHALL provide an iOS app-extension target conforming to the iOS 26.1 `PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension` protocol (an ExtensionKit `AppExtension`, declared via a `@main` Swift principal class), embedded in the host app with `NSExtensionPointIdentifier = com.apple.photos.background-upload`. The extension's logic SHALL live in a lean Kotlin Multiplatform module (`:app:ios:photokit-extension`) that depends on `:domain:engine`, `:capability:upload-url` (the real `EdgeUploadRequestProvider`), and `:capability:config` (the Keychain-backed `ConfigSource`) — no Compose/UI — packaged as its own static framework. The Swift shell SHALL be a thin pass-through that forwards `process()` and `notifyTermination()` into the Kotlin core; all discovery, decision, ledger, and job-disposition logic SHALL be Kotlin/Native. The extension `Info.plist` SHALL declare `BackgroundUploadURLBase` as the build setting `$(BACKGROUND_UPLOAD_URL_BASE)` (the compile-time edge host the system permits). The extension SHALL NOT relax App Transport Security: the `Info.plist` SHALL declare no `NSAppTransportSecurity` exception (no `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`, no `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`), so default ATS applies and the upload host MUST be a valid HTTPS endpoint. Supplying a non-HTTPS host is a build/configuration error; iOS blocks the plaintext request at the platform level.

#### Scenario: Extension declares the PhotoKit background-upload point
- **WHEN** the extension target is built
- **THEN** its Info.plist declares `NSExtensionPointIdentifier = com.apple.photos.background-upload`, a principal class, and `BackgroundUploadURLBase = $(BACKGROUND_UPLOAD_URL_BASE)`, it links the `:app:ios:photokit-extension` framework, and it declares **no** `NSAppTransportSecurity` exception (default HTTPS-only ATS)

#### Scenario: Logic is Kotlin, shell is thin
- **WHEN** the system invokes `process()` on the Swift principal class
- **THEN** the shell delegates to the Kotlin core, which performs all discovery, engine decisions, ledger writes, and job disposition

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: App primes Local Network access for the upload host

**Reason**: The priming probe existed only so the app could grant the iOS Local Network permission that the background extension needs to reach a **private/LAN** upload host over plaintext. With the local upload backend removed and the upload host now a public HTTPS endpoint, no Local Network permission applies and the probe is a permanent no-op.

**Migration**: None. The host app no longer makes any throwaway connection at launch; `LocalNetworkPriming.kt` and its call site are deleted. Uploads against the public HTTPS backend require no Local Network permission, so no behavior is lost.
