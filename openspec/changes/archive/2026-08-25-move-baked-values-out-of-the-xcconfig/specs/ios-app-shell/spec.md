## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote-notification capability declaration

The iOS app SHALL declare the push capability required to receive silent remote notifications: the
`aps-environment` entitlement in `iosApp.entitlements` (`development` for dev/sideloaded builds,
`production` for TestFlight/App Store, driven by the build configuration) and the `remote-notification`
value in `UIBackgroundModes` in `Info.plist` (so a `content-available` push can wake the app in the
background). The APNs environment the device registers (`sandbox` | `production`) SHALL be a
compile-time value read from the bundled `Deployment.plist` (`apnsEnv`, capability
`deployment-configuration`), consistent with the `aps-environment` the entitlement declares — both
derived from the one build-channel discriminator, so they cannot disagree. The read SHALL go through the
single adapter-side reader in `:adapter:ios:ext-safe`, never an inline bundle read in `:app:ios`, because
the absent-key default is a decision and the shell is gated to hold none.

#### Scenario: The app declares the push entitlement and background mode

- **WHEN** the app is built
- **THEN** `iosApp.entitlements` carries `aps-environment` and `Info.plist` `UIBackgroundModes`
  includes `remote-notification`

#### Scenario: Dev builds register the sandbox environment

- **WHEN** a dev/sideloaded build registers its token
- **THEN** the entitlement is `development` and the reported APNs `env` is `sandbox`; a
  TestFlight/App Store build reports `production`
