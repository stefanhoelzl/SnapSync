## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Test iOS on every push

The system SHALL run a **GitHub Actions** job (`ios-test` in `.github/workflows/ios.yml`) on every push, **in parallel** with the `ios-build` job, on a **`macos-26` hosted runner**. The job SHALL run `./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test`, which boots an iOS simulator and executes, compiled to **Kotlin/Native** for the `iosSimulatorArm64` target, **every** test source set that target compiles: the shared modules' `commonTest` suites **and** the iOS adapter modules' `iosTest` and `iosSimulatorArm64Test` suites, which have no JVM equivalent and therefore run nowhere else. The job SHALL post a stable status-check context (`ios-test`) used to gate merges. The `ios-test` and `ios-build` jobs together exercise both Kotlin/Native targets — `iosSimulatorArm64` via the test, `iosArm64` via the build.

#### Scenario: A push triggers the iOS test check
- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to any branch
- **THEN** the `ios-test` job runs `iosSimulatorArm64Test` on `macos-26`, booting an iOS simulator and running the shared `commonTest` together with the iOS adapter modules' `iosTest`/`iosSimulatorArm64Test` suites compiled to Kotlin/Native, and reports an `ios-test` status check on the pushed commit

#### Scenario: Test success reports a passing check
- **WHEN** the Kotlin/Native simulator unit tests all pass
- **THEN** the `ios-test` status check concludes as success (green)

#### Scenario: Test failure reports a failing check
- **WHEN** a Kotlin/Native simulator unit test fails
- **THEN** the `ios-test` status check concludes as failure (red)

#### Scenario: Test runs in parallel with the build
- **WHEN** the iOS workflow runs
- **THEN** the `ios-test` and `ios-build` jobs run as independent parallel jobs (neither waits on the other)
