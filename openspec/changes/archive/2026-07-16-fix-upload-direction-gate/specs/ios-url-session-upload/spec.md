## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The pump reimplements the OS scheduler

The app-driven tier SHALL provide a `BackgroundUploadPump` (in `:capability:upload`, platform-free)
that drives `UploadCycle.run()` — the in-app replacement for the OS-owned `process()` scheduler. The
pump SHALL be invoked by six triggers: (a) producer start, (b) app foreground entry, (c) a
`BGProcessingTask` handler, (d) background-`URLSession` completion relaunch
(`handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession`), (e) a per-upload completion delegate callback, and (f) a
**silent push for the active event**. The pump SHALL be **single-flight**: at most one
`UploadCycle.run()` executes at a time; concurrent triggers coalesce into a trailing re-run so no two
cycles write the ledger concurrently. On a `PROCESSING` result the pump SHALL re-arm: in the
foreground it SHALL wait for the next completion (which frees a slot) rather than busy-looping the cap;
in a background context it SHALL ensure the next `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled.

On a `SKIPPED` result — the cycle declined because the membership contributes nothing (capability
`upload-lifecycle`) — the pump SHALL schedule **nothing**, at every trigger. A non-contributing device
SHALL therefore hold no `BGProcessingTask`, and SHALL stop waking once any outstanding one fires. Re-arming
a device that will never upload would wake it forever to do nothing.

The pump's re-arm decision SHALL be expressed over the `CycleResult` variants exhaustively, so a future
variant cannot silently inherit a re-arm policy nobody chose for it.

#### Scenario: Concurrent triggers do not run cycles in parallel
- **WHEN** a completion callback and a `BGProcessingTask` fire while a cycle is running
- **THEN** they coalesce; exactly one additional cycle runs after the current one finishes

#### Scenario: PROCESSING on a full cap waits for a completion in foreground
- **WHEN** `UploadCycle.run()` returns `PROCESSING` because the cap is full while foregrounded
- **THEN** the pump does not immediately re-run; the next `URLSession` completion re-invokes it

#### Scenario: SKIPPED never re-arms the heartbeat
- **WHEN** `UploadCycle.run()` returns `SKIPPED` at any trigger, including the `BGProcessingTask` handler
  whose re-arm is otherwise unconditional
- **THEN** no `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled, so the device stops waking to upload

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A silent push drives an upload scan

A silent push for the device's **active event** SHALL drive an upload cycle on this tier, and SHALL re-arm
the heartbeat. The `BGProcessingTask` heartbeat is scheduled at the OS's discretion and is routinely deferred
well beyond its `earliestBeginDate`; a silent push is the reliable wake, and it arrives precisely when an
event is live, because it is emitted when another member's device drains a cycle that completed an upload
(capability `upload-completion-notify`).

The active-event decision SHALL live in a tested capability, in a receive seam mirroring the download arm's
(`DownloadPushReceiver`, capability `photo-download`), and SHALL NOT be duplicated in the composition root.
The root SHALL compose the upload and download receivers behind a fan-out so a push drives both arms.

The active-event guard SHALL be **orthogonal** to the direction gate (capability `upload-lifecycle`): the
active-event guard answers "is this push for my current event", the direction gate answers "should this device
ever upload here". A push for an event that is not the active one SHALL drive no cycle — notably a locally-left
event, whose backend membership persists (leave is local-only, capability `leave-event`) and which therefore
keeps pushing this device.

The push handler SHALL release the OS completion handler promptly and SHALL NOT hold it for the cycle: iOS
grants a silent push a short budget, and a library walk can exceed it. The scan is therefore best-effort — a
cycle cut short by suspension advances no discovery cursor, so the next wake simply redoes it.

#### Scenario: A push for the active event drives a cycle and re-arms
- **WHEN** a silent push arrives naming the device's active event on a contributing membership
- **THEN** an upload cycle is driven and the next `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled

#### Scenario: A push for another event drives nothing
- **WHEN** a silent push arrives naming an event that is not the device's active event, including a
  locally-left event the backend still pushes
- **THEN** no upload cycle is driven

#### Scenario: A push to a download-only membership passes the active-event guard and still uploads nothing
- **WHEN** a silent push arrives for the active event on a membership whose direction excludes upload
- **THEN** the receiver drives the pump (the active-event guard passes) and the cycle returns `SKIPPED`, so
  no upload job is created and no heartbeat is scheduled

#### Scenario: The push completion handler is not held for the cycle
- **WHEN** a silent push drives an upload cycle
- **THEN** the OS completion handler is released without waiting for the cycle to drain

### Requirement: Foreground entry re-arms the heartbeat

App foreground entry SHALL re-arm the `BGProcessingTask` heartbeat for a contributing membership, in
addition to driving a cycle.

Without this, the heartbeat's liveness depends entirely on an unbroken chain from a producer start through
each handler's re-submission. A force-quit cancels every pending `BGTaskScheduler` request and the OS does not
relaunch the app until the user opens it — so nothing re-arms until the next producer start (a provision or a
permission grant). Reopening the app, which is exactly when the device is available to be re-armed, did not.

#### Scenario: Foreground recovers a heartbeat lost to a force-quit
- **WHEN** the app is force-quit (cancelling its scheduled `BGProcessingTask`) and the user later reopens it
  on a contributing membership, with no provision or permission transition occurring
- **THEN** a `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled, so the device resumes waking to catch new photos

#### Scenario: Foreground on a non-contributing membership arms nothing
- **WHEN** the app foregrounds on a membership whose direction excludes upload
- **THEN** the cycle returns `SKIPPED` and no `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled
