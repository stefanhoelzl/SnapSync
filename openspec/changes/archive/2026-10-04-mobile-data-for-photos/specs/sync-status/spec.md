# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Direction arrows show remaining work and live transfer

While work remains, the status line SHALL show an upload arrow when some of the member's photos are
not yet shared and a download arrow when some of the others' photos have not yet arrived. An arrow
SHALL pulse while a transfer in its direction is actually running and stay still while work waits; the
line SHALL read "Synchronization ongoing…" when any arrow pulses, "Waiting for Wi-Fi…" when no arrow
pulses and the work waits because the member chose not to use mobile data for photos and the phone is on a
network that choice avoids (capability `mobile-data`), and "Synchronization pending…" otherwise. "In sync" SHALL be shown exactly when neither arrow is shown. A direction the member switched
off has no work and therefore no arrow — but if the app ever does work in a switched-off direction, that
arrow SHALL be shown rather than hidden.

#### Scenario: A new photo waiting to upload
- **WHEN** the member takes an in-range photo and no upload is running yet
- **THEN** a still upload arrow appears with "Synchronization pending…"

#### Scenario: Photos arriving
- **WHEN** the member's uploads are done and others' photos are downloading
- **THEN** only the download arrow shows, pulsing, with "Synchronization ongoing…"

#### Scenario: Receive-only ignores the member's own gallery
- **WHEN** a receive-only member has unshared photos in their library and all received photos have
  arrived
- **THEN** the status line reads "In sync"

#### Scenario: Work in a switched-off direction is not masked
- **WHEN** a receive-only member's device nevertheless has uploads outstanding
- **THEN** the upload arrow is shown and the line does not read "In sync"

#### Scenario: Photos waiting for Wi-Fi are named
- **WHEN** a member with mobile data off is on mobile data and has a photo waiting to upload
- **THEN** a still upload arrow is shown with "Waiting for Wi-Fi…"

#### Scenario: Reaching Wi-Fi replaces the waiting line
- **WHEN** that member's phone joins an unrestricted Wi-Fi while the app is open
- **THEN** the waiting line is replaced by "Synchronization ongoing…" while the photo uploads
