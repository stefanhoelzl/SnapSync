## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Portrait-only orientation

The iOS app SHALL be presented in upright portrait orientation only. The app SHALL target iPhone only (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1"`), and its `Info.plist` SHALL declare `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` as exactly `[UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait]` (no `~ipad` variant, which is not honored for an iPhone-only target), so the UI never rotates to landscape or to upside-down portrait. Targeting iPhone only also avoids the App Store iPad-multitasking validation rule (TMS-90474) that requires a universal app to declare all four orientations. The lock SHALL be the static plist declaration; no runtime per-view-controller orientation override is used.

#### Scenario: Rotating an iPhone to landscape does not rotate the UI
- **WHEN** the app is running on an iPhone and the device is turned to a landscape orientation
- **THEN** the UI stays in upright portrait and does not rotate to landscape or upside-down

#### Scenario: Running on an iPad stays in portrait
- **WHEN** the app runs on an iPad (in iPhone-compatibility mode, since it targets iPhone only) and the device is rotated
- **THEN** the UI stays in upright portrait and does not present a landscape layout
