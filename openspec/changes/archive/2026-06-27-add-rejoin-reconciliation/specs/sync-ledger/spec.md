## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Storage seam — dumb row store
The ledger SHALL access storage exclusively through a `LedgerBackend` interface with the row
operations `get(key): LedgerEntry?` and `put(entry)` (a single-row upsert), the aggregate read
`aggregates(): LedgerAggregates`, a change signal `changes: Flow<Unit>`, `clear()` — a
delete-all reset, `resetTo(entries)` — an **atomic** delete-all-then-insert-all replacement, and two
asset-targeted bulk removals: `deleteByAssetId(assetId)` — delete every row whose `assetId` equals
the argument — and `retainAssets(keep)` — delete every row whose `assetId` is not in the `keep` set.
Backends SHALL store entries verbatim (no interpretation, no precedence logic, last write wins, no
clocks of their own). A `LedgerEntry` SHALL carry `key`, `assetId`, `state` (`REQUESTED` |
`COMPLETED` | `FAILED`), `attempt`, `version`, and `updatedAt: Instant`. `clear()`, `resetTo`,
`deleteByAssetId`, and `retainAssets` SHALL each remove (and, for `resetTo`, then insert) the matching
rows and signal `changes` **once** like a `put` (so watchers re-read the now-current truth).
`clear()`, `resetTo`, `deleteByAssetId`, and `retainAssets` are **reset/bulk** operations, not the
per-key **record** operations; recording per-upload facts remains the single-record-writer's job
(`LedgerWriter`), so a non-writer holder of the backend may reset the store without breaching the
single-record-writer invariant. `assetId` is a second opaque field: the backend stores, groups, and
matches it by equality but never interprets it (it does not know what an "asset" means — any value is
valid, set by the caller), so the ledger remains a dumb, platform-neutral row store.

#### Scenario: Put then get round-trips
- **WHEN** `put(entry)` is called and then `get(entry.key)`
- **THEN** the returned entry equals the one put, field for field — including `assetId` and `updatedAt`

#### Scenario: Put overwrites unconditionally
- **WHEN** `put` is called twice for the same key with different states
- **THEN** `get` returns the second entry — the backend applies no precedence of its own

#### Scenario: Unknown key reads null
- **WHEN** `get` is called for a key never put
- **THEN** it returns null

#### Scenario: Clear empties the store and signals
- **WHEN** `clear()` is called on a store holding rows
- **THEN** every subsequent `get` returns null, `aggregates()` reports zero pending and completed,
  and a `changes` signal is emitted

#### Scenario: Reset replaces all rows and signals once
- **WHEN** `resetTo(entries)` is called on a store holding different rows
- **THEN** every prior key not in `entries` returns null, every key in `entries` returns its supplied
  entry verbatim, and exactly one `changes` signal is emitted

#### Scenario: Delete by assetId removes only that asset's rows and signals
- **WHEN** the store holds rows for assetId `A` (keys `A-photo.jpg`, `A-video.mov`) and assetId `B`
  (key `B-photo.jpg`), and `deleteByAssetId("A")` is called
- **THEN** `get("A-photo.jpg")` and `get("A-video.mov")` return null, `get("B-photo.jpg")` is
  unchanged, and a `changes` signal is emitted

#### Scenario: Retain assets removes the complement and signals
- **WHEN** the store holds rows for assetIds `A`, `B`, and `C`, and `retainAssets({"A", "C"})` is called
- **THEN** the `B` rows return null, the `A` and `C` rows are unchanged, and a `changes` signal is emitted

#### Scenario: Retain with empty set empties the store
- **WHEN** `retainAssets(emptySet)` is called on a store holding rows
- **THEN** every subsequent `get` returns null and a `changes` signal is emitted

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Atomic baseline reset

`LedgerBackend.resetTo(entries)` SHALL replace the entire store with `entries` in a single atomic
transaction: either all prior rows are removed and all `entries` inserted, or — on failure or
interruption — the store is left unchanged (no partial replacement is ever observable). It SHALL emit
exactly one `changes` signal on success. Entries are stored verbatim (the caller supplies `state`,
`version`, and `updatedAt`); `resetTo` performs no clock stamping of its own. On the SQLDelight
backend it SHALL execute as one transaction.

#### Scenario: Interrupted reset leaves the store unchanged
- **WHEN** a `resetTo` transaction fails partway (e.g. an insert errors)
- **THEN** the store retains exactly its pre-call rows and no `changes` signal claims a new baseline

#### Scenario: Reset to a non-empty baseline is observable as a whole
- **WHEN** `resetTo(entries)` succeeds over a previously empty store
- **THEN** `aggregates()` reflects all `entries` at once and `get` returns each supplied entry verbatim

#### Scenario: Reset baseline holds on the SQLDelight backend
- **WHEN** the reset scenarios run against the SQLDelight backend on a JVM sqlite driver
- **THEN** they pass unchanged (a single-transaction replacement, one change signal)
