# architecture-guards — delta for uniform-adapter-tree

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The fake-honesty gate
Every public type in `:adapter:generic:fake` SHALL expose only members of the port interfaces it
implements plus a constructor taking initial state — no public mutable properties, no non-port
public functions. Operator rigging lives in `:test:world` wrappers, never in fakes.

#### Scenario: A lever lands in a fake
- **WHEN** a fake gains a public `var` or a public function outside its port contract
- **THEN** the gate fails; the lever moves to a world wrapper
