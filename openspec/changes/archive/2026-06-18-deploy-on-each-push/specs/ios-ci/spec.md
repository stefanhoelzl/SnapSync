## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Build iOS on every push

The system SHALL run a **GitHub Actions** job (`ios-build` in `.github/workflows/ios.yml`) on every push that builds the iOS **device (`iphoneos`, arm64)** app on a **`macos-26` hosted runner**, linking the `iosArm64` framework with the runner's **GM Xcode** (no Xcode beta), and reports a stable status-check context (`ios-build`) used to gate merges. On **every** ref the job SHALL produce a **signed archive** of the device app (cloud-managed signing — capability `ios-testflight-delivery`); the archive compiles `iosArm64`, so the `ios-build` check reflects whether the device app builds, and the same archive is the TestFlight delivery source. The job SHALL run no tests and boot no simulator. The device app SHALL be compiled exactly once per push.

#### Scenario: A push triggers the iOS build check
- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to any branch
- **THEN** the `ios-build` job builds the iOS device (arm64) app on `macos-26` with the runner's GM Xcode and reports an `ios-build` status check on the pushed commit

#### Scenario: Build success reports a passing check
- **WHEN** the device app's signed archive compiles successfully
- **THEN** the `ios-build` status check concludes as success (green)

#### Scenario: Build failure reports a failing check
- **WHEN** the device app fails to compile
- **THEN** the `ios-build` status check concludes as failure (red)

#### Scenario: Every ref signs and delivers
- **WHEN** the `ios-build` job runs on any ref
- **THEN** it produces a signed archive of the device app and delivers it to TestFlight (capability `ios-testflight-delivery`), executing no tests and no simulator boot, while the `ios-build` check still reflects whether the device app compiles

#### Scenario: No beta Xcode is used
- **WHEN** the iOS workflow runs
- **THEN** it uses the `macos-26` runner's GM Xcode and does not select an Xcode beta SDK
