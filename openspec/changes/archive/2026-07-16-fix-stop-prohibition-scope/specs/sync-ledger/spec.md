## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Lifecycle transitions never clear the ledger

`clear()` SHALL NOT be used as a membership-lifecycle mechanism. No provision, re-provision, event
switch, permission change, direction change, or **leave** SHALL call `clear()` on the ledger
(`upload-lifecycle`, "Upload producer seam has no destructive verb").

The ledger is **device-global dedup state**, not event state: its key is the bare resource filename
with no event scoping (see "Event-independent key"), and leaving an event does not remove the device's
bytes from its storage partition. A `COMPLETED` row therefore stays **true** across a leave, a switch,
and a re-join — and clearing it would force a re-upload of every already-stored resource on the next
join.

The discovery cursor is **not** part of this prohibition, because it is not dedup state. It records where
an incremental scan resumes; a tier may clear it to repair its own mechanism (`upload-lifecycle`), and a
reconciliation clears it whenever it re-baselines (`event-rejoin-reconciliation`). What that costs is a
full re-enumeration whose every resource is already `COMPLETED` here — which is precisely why the ledger
is the thing that must not be cleared, and the cursor is not.

The **only** operation that re-baselines the ledger SHALL be `resetTo`, invoked by a triggered
reconciliation against the authoritative per-device listing (`event-rejoin-reconciliation`). Ledger and
storage may diverge only at a (re)join, and reconciliation — not a lifecycle wipe — is what closes that
divergence.

`clear()` SHALL remain on the `LedgerBackend` seam (it is the semantic basis of `resetTo` and is used
by test and harness backends), but it SHALL have no membership-lifecycle caller.

#### Scenario: Leaving an event preserves every ledger row

- **WHEN** the user leaves the currently-joined event
- **THEN** the ledger retains every row, so joining any event afterwards re-uploads nothing already in the device's byte partition — whether or not the tier's `stop()` cleared its discovery cursor

#### Scenario: Re-provisioning preserves every ledger row

- **WHEN** the device switches to a different event
- **THEN** the switch itself clears nothing; only the reconciliation's `resetTo` re-baselines the ledger, from the per-device listing

#### Scenario: Only reconciliation re-baselines the ledger

- **WHEN** the ledger is re-baselined
- **THEN** the re-baseline is a `resetTo` from an authoritative per-device listing, never a lifecycle-driven `clear()`
