# ios-app-shell — delta for complete-architecture-migration

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: iOS live composition root
The `:app:ios` module SHALL provide a composition-root singleton (`SnapSyncRoot`, `iosMain`) that
owns an app-lifetime `CoroutineScope` (a `SupervisorJob` on the main dispatcher) and assembles the
live stack **through the shared composition** `snapSyncApp` (`:domain` `compose/`, spec
`module-architecture` "One shared composition"): the root constructs the platform adapters and
supplies them as `AppPorts` — platform effect lambdas included (the trigger-time membership
re-read `reloadConfig` (bound to the config adapter's `reload()`), the backstop scheduling, the
share-sheet presentation, and the resolved
tier's mechanism thunks) — and `snapSyncApp` composes the feature graph: the **ledger-backed**
`SyncStatusSource` (built from a `LedgerCountsSource`, the permission source, and the gallery
source — see `sync-status`), the **foreground-gated ledger-counts poll** (`LedgerCountsPoller`,
started/stopped by the Foreground/Background flows — see `sync-status`), the attestation,
upload-arm, join/leave/create use-cases, the download
controller and jobs, the album coordinator, the `flow/` trigger instances (Foreground · Background
· SilentPush · DownloadBackstop · Provision), and the **user-tap command bundle**
(`model/`'s `UserCommands`: leave · create · commitJoin · share · requestAccess · openSettings —
seated in `model/` since migration step 9, because the armed presentation gate forbids
`:ui:presentation` naming `flow/`; live instances are still built and decorated only in
`compose/`), which the root injects into the `StatusContainerHost` — presentation fires commands
only through the bundle and references no feature command, port, or flow callable directly. The
root passes the PhotoKit permission adapter's **permission StateFlow** and the file-backed config
adapter's **config StateFlow** into the host (since step 9 the host's read-model inputs are bare
StateFlows — presentation names no `ports/` type), supplies the same permission adapter as
`AppPorts.photoAccessRequester` (the port the bundle's `requestAccess`/`openSettings` commands are
bound to in `compose/`), and passes the file-backed config adapter (the App-Group config store of
record — capability `event-link`)
as both the `ConfigSource` and
`ConfigStore` in `AppPorts`. The root SHALL bind the `Clock`/`TimeZoneSource` ports' system
adapters (`:adapter:generic`'s `SystemClock`/`SystemTimeZone`) into the **one shared, pure**
`CutoffFormatter` (its now/zone arrive injected — the through-ports repayment of step 9) handed to
the host, the screen, and the forge factory; the formatter is root-owned rather than
`AppCore`-owned deliberately, so the forge composition reaches it with no route to the live
graph. The composed graph SHALL construct the iOS
`LedgerCountsSource` as a **read-only** reader of the shared App-Group ledger — supplying a
`suspend () -> LedgerCounts` that calls only `iosLedgerStore().aggregates()` (never a write) — and
SHALL issue **no** storage LIST for upload status. On the OS-driven tier the composed graph SHALL
construct **no `LedgerWriter`** (the ledger read is read-only; the extension is the sole writer)
and **no `EventStatusSource`** (the ledger is private to the extension, which also owns
reconciliation — see `event-rejoin-reconciliation`).

The root SHALL resolve its composition **once per process** through the pure sealed resolver
(`model/`'s `resolveComposition` over the parsed `LaunchDirectives` and `OsFacts`) and SHALL switch
on the resolved `CompositionMode` in exactly **one** place, selecting a per-mode shell delegate
(forge or live, with the live tier's mechanism thunks bound in the same switch). Every OS entry
point (`onForeground` / `onBackground` / `onOpenUrl` / `onPushToken` / `onSilentPush` /
`runUploadHeartbeat` / `runDownloadBackstop` / `handleBackgroundUrlSession`) SHALL be a thin
delegator to that resolved delegate, re-checking no forge or tier flag.

The permission-grant subscriptions (upload-arm start on grant; sole-creator album ensure — see
`event-album`) SHALL be installed by an explicit `AppCore.installPermissionSubscriptions()`
(`compose/`) invoked **only from the root's host-assembly path**: a cold background wake (the
download backstop or a background-`URLSession` relaunch) that merely touches the composed graph
SHALL NOT install them, so no producer start fires off the permission StateFlow's replay outside
host assembly.

The root SHALL observe the app's foreground/background lifecycle **from Kotlin**: a plain
`onLaunch()` entry — called by the Swift `AppDelegate` from `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, a
statement with no decision — installs process-lifetime `NSNotificationCenter` observers for
`UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification` (→ `onForeground`) and
`UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification` (→ `onBackground`), replacing the SwiftUI
`scenePhase` split (a Swift decision the transcriber law forbids). The foreground entry drives the
Foreground flow (which re-reads the membership, refreshes status, and **starts** the
foreground-gated poll); the background entry drives the Background flow (which **stops** the poll
and arms the backstop). A background launch installs the observers and simply never receives
`didBecomeActive`. The scope SHALL outlive Compose
recomposition so the source collector and container are not torn down with the view.
`MainViewController` SHALL render `host.container.stateFlow` and route the gate intents to
`host.onRequestPermission` / `host.onOpenSettings`, the leave action to `host.onLeaveEvent`, and
the share action to `host.onShareInvite`; it SHALL collect the container's invite URL
(`host.inviteUrl`) and pass it to `StatusScreen`, together with the root's shared
`CutoffFormatter` (the screen carries no system-reading default). `SnapSyncRoot` SHALL expose
`onUserActivity(NSUserActivity)` — the scene delegate forwards every delivered activity **whole**,
and the tested `model/` filter-and-dispatch (`forwardEventLink`) keeps only a browsing-web
activity with a URL and routes its complete `absoluteString` to `onOpenUrl(String)`, which
reaches the container's `onOpenUrl` intent (through the live delegate).

#### Scenario: The root assembles the real stack

- **WHEN** the iOS app starts
- **THEN** a single `SnapSyncRoot` resolves the composition mode once, constructs the platform
  adapters and calls `snapSyncApp`, which composes the ledger-backed `SyncStatusSource` (with the
  read-only `LedgerCountsSource`), the flows, and the user-tap command bundle over the PhotoKit
  permission adapter and the file-backed config store; the root wires the result into one
  `StatusContainerHost` — constructing no `LedgerWriter` on the OS-driven tier and no
  `EventStatusSource`, and issuing no storage LIST for upload status

#### Scenario: The foreground poll keeps status live while foreground

- **WHEN** the app is foregrounded and the extension records ledger changes in its own process
- **THEN** the foreground-gated poll re-reads the ledger counts within its cadence and a fresh
  status emission follows, with no network read

#### Scenario: The poll is foreground-only

- **WHEN** the app moves to the background
- **THEN** the Background flow stops the poll, and the next foreground entry (which itself also
  refreshes status) starts it again

#### Scenario: Lifecycle transitions are observed from Kotlin

- **WHEN** the app becomes active, or leaves the active state (including a transient interruption
  such as the app switcher or an incoming call)
- **THEN** the Kotlin-installed `NSNotificationCenter` observers drive `onForeground`,
  respectively `onBackground`, with no scene-phase decision in Swift

#### Scenario: Permission action flows through the container

- **WHEN** the user activates the gate's "Allow access" or "Open Settings"
- **THEN** `MainViewController` invokes the container intent, which fires the bundle's
  `requestAccess`/`openSettings` command, whose compose-built body calls the
  `PhotoAccessRequester` port — the UI never calls PhotoKit directly and names no port

#### Scenario: An event link flows through the container

- **WHEN** `SnapSyncRoot.onUserActivity` receives a browsing-web activity carrying a
  `https://<link domain>/join#…` event link
- **THEN** the tested filter routes the complete URL to `onOpenUrl`, which forwards (through the
  live delegate) to the container's `onOpenUrl` intent, which decodes and (on success) saves via
  the `ConfigStore` (the file-backed config store, which also writes through to its Keychain
  copy), updating the `ConfigSource`

#### Scenario: The leave action flows through the command bundle into the use-case

- **WHEN** the user confirms the leave action in the joined layer
- **THEN** `MainViewController` invokes `host.onLeaveEvent`, which fires the bundle's `leave`
  command — cancelling in-flight downloads, then running the composed `LeaveEvent` (stopping the
  producer via the tier-neutral arm and clearing the persisted config — the App-Group file; no
  ledger or `EventStatus`
  operation) — and the screen returns to the setup gate

#### Scenario: The share action flows through the command bundle into the platform share

- **WHEN** the user activates the share action in the joined layer
- **THEN** `MainViewController` invokes `host.onShareInvite`, which fires the bundle's `share`
  command with the invite link, and the shell-supplied lambda — `:adapter:ios:app-only`'s
  `presentShareSheet`, whose presenter walk is adapter technology mechanics — presents a
  `UIActivityViewController` carrying that link; the UI never constructs UIKit directly and
  observes no result

#### Scenario: A cold background wake installs no grant subscription

- **WHEN** the process is launched in the background by the download backstop or a
  background-`URLSession` relaunch, without the host-assembly path running
- **THEN** touching the composed graph installs no permission-grant collector, and no upload
  producer starts off the permission StateFlow's replayed `GRANTED` value

### Requirement: Register for remote notifications and forward the token

On launch the app SHALL register for remote notifications (`UIApplication.registerForRemoteNotifications`)
and, when the OS delivers the APNs device token (`didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken`),
forward the token — as the encoded token string plus the compile-time `env` — into the Kotlin push
seam (`:domain` `feature/push` over the `ports/` token source) for registration with the backend. A registration failure
(`didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError`) SHALL be logged and SHALL NOT crash or block the
app. The Swift `AppDelegate` SHALL perform **no** decision logic — it is a pass-through to Kotlin,
consistent with the existing deeplink / background-URL-session hooks.

#### Scenario: The delivered device token reaches the push seam

- **WHEN** the OS delivers the APNs device token to the `AppDelegate`
- **THEN** the token string and the compile-time `env` are forwarded to the Kotlin push registration
  path, which writes the device config to the backend

#### Scenario: A registration error does not crash the app

- **WHEN** remote-notification registration fails
- **THEN** the failure is logged and the app continues running normally
