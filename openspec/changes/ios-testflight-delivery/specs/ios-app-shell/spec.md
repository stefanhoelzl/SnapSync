## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Buildable for the iOS simulator

The `:app:ios` module and its full module dependency closure SHALL compile for the `iosSimulatorArm64` target, and an Xcode project (`iosApp/`) SHALL build a runnable simulator `.app` via `xcodebuild`. The shared modules SHALL also declare the `iosArm64` (device) target. The **simulator** build SHALL require no code signing; a signed **device** archive is produced separately by the `ios-testflight-delivery` capability and is not part of the simulator build or the merge gate.

#### Scenario: Simulator app builds
- **WHEN** `xcodebuild` builds the `iosApp` scheme for the iOS simulator
- **THEN** the app and every module in its dependency closure compile for `iosSimulatorArm64` and a `.app` bundle is produced

#### Scenario: No code signing required for the simulator build
- **WHEN** the simulator app is built
- **THEN** the build completes without code-signing assets (no Apple Developer certificate or provisioning profile)
